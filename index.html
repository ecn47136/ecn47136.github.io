<h2><b><font color="Blue">A Day at the Deli</font></b></h2>
<p>My name is Edward Nitka, and I am a Sophomore student at the University of Georgia. I have lived in New Jersey for my entire life until I came to school in Georgia. When I lived in New Jersey, I worked at a delicatessen for two years. My most important job at the deli was to make delicious sandwiches for customers. On top of sandwich-making, I was responsible for plenty of cleaning and stocking various items. I also assisted the kitchen and catering staff in any way I could. It would often be extremely busy in the deli, and I often found myself working long hours and overtime. It was a very fast-paced and strenuous environment. Our staff was comprised of people from very different age groups and backgrounds. My coworkers consisted of people such as fellow high school students, young adults, and older adults who worked to support their families.</p>

<h4><b><font color="Blue">Brennan's Importance in My Town</font></b></h4>
<p>In my small hometown of Rumson, New Jersey, Brennan's deli was one of the most popular places around. It is a very family friendly spot, as people of all ages would walk through the deli doors to enjoy delicious food. Employees were very proud to serve the hungry students, teachers, and workers of our community. The deli was a spot were friends could meet up any day to hang out and enjoy good food. The small restaurant brought our small community together. Brennan's was always very busy, and it brought a lot of money into our local economy. In the summer, there was often a line extending out of the door. Summer tourists always made the trip to Brennan's before heading to the beach, which is only five minutes away from the store. The small deli was also always busy in the non-summer months. Brennan's may have been a very small establishment, however that did not put a halt to the very large impact it had on my community.</p>
<h><b><font color="Blue">A Quote on the Deli From the Asbury Park Press</font></b></h>
<blockquote cite="https://www.app.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/10/29/new-restaurants-jersey-shore/1738509002/">"Sandwiches are a staple at Brennan's; When the deli first opened, Yurish said he and his brother (and partner at the time) had ingredients "for every kind of sandwich, but the customers were kind of confused. So we made a short list of sandwich combinations and the customers really embraced them. But we kind of got bored making those sandwiches, so we put up a chalkboard and started making eight more. Then we put up another chalkboard. Then we ended up with four chalkboards."</blockquote>
<h><b><font color="Blue">Brennan's Influence on Me</font></b></h>
<p>Working at a deli tought me many valueable lessons. It was a very challenging place to work. Whenever I was at work, I would never be able to stand around and do nothing. My managers used to always tell me, "If there is time to lean, there is time to clean." That is a quote that I will never foget. Brennan's deli tought me how to work hard in a fast paced environment. I also learned how to work hard through my coworkers. Many of my coworkers were immigrants who were working their hardest to support families. For me, Brennan's seemed like a part-time job. For many of my coworkers, Brennan's was a career. Many of these older workers did not respect me at first, so I worked even harder to try and gain their respect. Many staff members would often bicker and argue about different situations that came about. However, this arguing was like that of a family. Our staff was just like a big, very different family. Brennan's tought me how to work hard, gain respect, and be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. </p>
